AUTOMATION SYSTEM - PROJECT NOTES
==================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
This automation system is designed to validate input files, generate summaries,
and produce detailed logs with safe failure handling.

Key Features:
-------------
1. File Validation
   - Checks for required file types (.txt, .csv, .json)
   - Validates that files are not empty
   - Handles permission errors gracefully
   
2. Summary Generation
   - Provides file count statistics
   - Calculates total sizes and line counts
   - Groups data by file type
   
3. Detailed Logging
   - Timestamps all operations
   - Color-coded console output
   - Comprehensive error messages
   - Saves to automation.log file

Design Decisions:
-----------------
- Uses only Python standard library (no external dependencies)
- Implements three exit codes:
  * 0 = Success
  * 1 = Validation failure (user error)
  * 2 = System error (unexpected failure)
  
- Safe failure approach:
  * All exceptions are caught and logged
  * Clear error messages without stack traces
  * Graceful degradation when possible

Edge Cases Handled:
-------------------
- Empty input folders
- Files with no content (0 bytes)
- Unreadable files (encoding issues)
- Permission denied errors
- Missing input folder
- Invalid paths

Future Improvements:
--------------------
- Add parallel processing for large file sets
- Support additional file formats (XML, YAML)
- Implement configurable validation rules
- Add email notifications for failures
- Create web dashboard for monitoring
- Add database integration for historical tracking

Test Scenarios:
---------------
1. Valid input folder with multiple files -> Should succeed
2. Empty folder -> Should fail with clear message
3. Folder with only empty files -> Should fail
4. Non-existent folder -> Should fail
5. Mix of valid and invalid files -> Should succeed with warnings

Notes:
------
- All file sizes are displayed in human-readable format (KB, MB, etc.)
- Line counting works for text-based files
- Encoding fallback ensures compatibility with various file formats
- Output folder is timestamped to prevent overwrites
